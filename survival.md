## Survival analysis

**Analyse these genes:**
1) ERBB2+
2) TP53-
3) MYC+
4) CDKN2A-

**Malignancies (assigned per group):**
1) NCIT:C3268 Nervous system neoplasm
2) NCIT:C3052 Digestive System Neoplasm
3) NCIT:C35813 Hematopoietic and Lymphoid System Neoplasm
4) NCIT:C9118 Sarcoma
5) NCIT:C3355 Respiratory System Neoplasm
6) Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma C39851 & Ductal Breast Carcinoma C4017


**Plots**
* Kaplan-Meier
* Duplication/deletion of gene per tumor type
* CNV distribution in different tumor types (violinplot)
* Your ideas ...

**Presentation guidelines**
* Introduction slides - prognosis, background, genotypes
* Please don't fill slides with text, keywords only
* All plots must have a title and axis labels (with units when applicable). Legends if necessary.
* Include summary/conclusions
* Push slides with tumor group as a title to github course_results/2022/survival
* List authors on title slide
